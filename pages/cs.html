        <h3>Basic Concepts</h3>
        <h4>Code.org</h4>
        <p>
            Well-known for its <a href="https://code.org/learn">Hour of Code</a> activites that are a low-commitment way to pique the interest of children, 
            Code.org features not only quick activities, but also full-length curriulums for grades K-12. 
            Its mission is to expand access to computer science in schools and increase participation by young women and students from other underrepresented groups. 
            Their curriculums feature videos and interactive activities with visuals for students to learn basic programming concepts, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. 
        </p>
        <h4>Scratch</h4>
        <p>
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> was designed to target children from ages 6 to 16, but can be used by people of all ages for free. 
            It uses <strong>block-based programming</strong> to teach concepts such as event listeners, loops, conditionals, operators, variables, and even functions! 
            If you're not sure where to start, Scratch also features tutorials and projects created by other users that can give you some inspiration. 
            Children particularly enjoy customizing sprites, backdrops, and sounds in order to create interactive games and stories.
        </p>
        <h4>Alice</h4>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.alice.org/">Alice</a> is a <strong>block-based programming</strong> tool available to download for free that can be used to create animations, build interactive narratives, and program simple games in 3D. 
            Named after the character in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, the goal of this team is to make computer programming fun and easy, just as Lewis Carroll made his books clear and entertaining. 
            Alice focuses on object-oriented programming, and a <a href="http://www.alice.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MediatedTransfer.pdf">study</a> on an undergraduate programming course 
            using Alice 3 and Java saw an increase in at least a letter grade when Alice was used as an intermediary step before Java, as opposed to solely using Java.

        <h3>Writing Your First Code</h3>
        <p>Particularly if you already have experience with programming concepts from block-based programming or any other way of training to "think like a programmer," 
            learning your first language shouldn't be too difficult! However, particularly if you do not have any prior experience (and even if you do), it's a good idea to follow a tutorial or other curriculum to learn your first langauge. 
            A good first language might be <strong>Python</strong>, although <strong>Java</strong> is commonly used in high schools, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> could also be a good starting point. 
            At this stage, if you are interested in building websites, it may also be a good idea to look into learning the basics of <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>.
        </p>
        <h4>Curriculums</h4>
        <p>
            High schools often offer introductory programming courses. Some also follow College Board's <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/course">AP Computer Science A</a> and 
            <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/course">AP Computer Science Principles</a> courses, which have ready-to-use curriculums you can follow along with from endorsed providers. 
            Besides high schools, many colleges have also published their introductory course materials.

        <h3>Languages</h3>
        <h4>Core Languages</h4>
        <p>
            After learning one language, it tends to be easier to pick up others. You already know the concepts, and now you just have to become attuned to syntax differences. Here are some languages that are probably useful to learn if you aren't already familiar with them: 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python</strong> has relatively simple syntax, and has many popular packages for artificial intelligence, data science, and financial services.</li>
                <li><strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> are the building blocks of front-end development. HTML designs the structure, CSS controls the styling, and JavaScript allows for animations and more complicated functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Java</strong> is frequently used in large companies, and can also be used to develop Android applications.</li>
                <li><strong>C</strong>, along with Python and Java, forms a solid foundation for programming as one of the "core languages." 
                    Its syntax is a bit more complex because it is older, but it can run on any device so it is often used to program hardware. 
                    <strong>C#</strong> is Microsoft's variant of C, intended to be faster and more secure.
                    <strong>C++</strong> is an extension of C, used for everything ranging from computer games to mathematical simulations.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>More Languages</h4>
        <p>
            There are many other languages that are a bit more specialized. Depending on your interests, you may want to investigate further into one or several of them. 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kotlin</strong> is often used to program Android applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Swift</strong> is used to program iOS and macOS (Apple) applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Go</strong> or <strong>Golang</strong> is used in applications that need to process a lot of data (in companies like Google, Netflix, Twitter, and Uber), but is not broadly used.</li>
                <li><strong>R</strong> is heavily used in statistics.</li>
                <li><strong>PHP</strong> is a scripting language like Python, widely used for server-side web development. 
                It is an older language used by companies like Facebook, Yahoo, and Wikipedia (and more than 80% of websites on the Internet!), but its popularity is dropping as JavaScript and Python have started replacing it.
                <strong>Ruby</strong> is also popular for web development that is relatively easy to prototype in.</li>
                <li><strong>MATLAB</strong>, <strong>Mathematica</strong>, and <strong>Julia</strong> are used for scientific research and scientific computing. MATLAB is older and more established, while Julia is newer but increasing in popularity.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Frameworks and Other Tools</h3>
        <h4>Frameworks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>React</strong> and <strong>Angular</strong> are the most popular JavaScript frameworks. </li>
            <li><strong>Node.js</strong> allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side, even though it was traditionally used as a client-side scripting language. </li>
            <li><strong>jQuery</strong> is another JavaScript framework for client-side scripting. You can do animation, send HTTP requests, reload pages, and perform client-side validation by writing just a couple of lines of code. </li>
            <li><strong>React Native</strong> and <strong>Flutter</strong> are used for cross-platform (Android and iOS) applications. </li>
            <li><strong>Bootstrap</strong> provides HTML- and CSS-based templates. </li>
            <li><strong>Firebase</strong> is Google's mobile platform that helps you quickly develop high-quality mobile apps and grow your business. </li>
            <li><strong>Django</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong> are popular Python frameworks. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Version Control</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Git</strong> is a version control system widely used in industry that is very important to learn about. 
        </p>
        <h4>Google!</h4>
        <p>
            Very soon (if you haven't already), you will discover that you do not, in fact, have the all the coding knowledge in the world. Make sure to leverage Google for resources like <strong>Stack Overflow</strong> to see if other people have had similar errors as you. 
        </p>
        <h4>Linux</h4>
        <p>
            Being comfortable with the Linux <strong>command line</strong> allows you to work effectively. You can search files, know what’s going on with the system by checking its CPU and memory usage, and many other perform basic and advanced tasks.
        </p>
        <h4>Cloud Computing</h4>
        <p>
            Cloud computing concepts and platforms like Amazon Web Services (<strong>AWS</strong>), Google Cloud Computing (<strong>GCP</strong>), Microsoft <strong>Azure</strong> are becoming ever-more important. 
        </p>
        <h4>Databases</h4>
        <p>
            There are many databases, but knowing one will get you started. It's a good idea to know how to insert, update, and delete data and write <strong>SQL</strong> queries to retrieve it. 
        </p>
        <h4>Containers</h4>
        <p><strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>Kubernetes</strong> provide you with tools for deployment, so that you don't have to worry about your application's scalability. </p>              
        <h3>Independent Practice</h3>
        <h4>Hackathons</h4>
        <p>As you're exploring new languages and frameworks, hackathons (check <a href="https://mlh.io/">MLH</a> or your local colleges and universities) offer a great chance to <strong>explore</strong> in just a weekend. Enlist your friends, or make new ones while enjoying free food! </p>
        <h4>Personal Projects</h4>
        <p>It's also important to have some projects that you've invested more time in. Is there a <strong>game</strong> you want to replicate? Try making a <strong>personal website</strong>, or a <strong>todo app</strong>. 
            Play around with web and app development, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and anything else that strikes your interest. 
        </p>
        <h4>Data Structure and Algorithms</h4>
        <p>
            A cornerstone of any technical interview with a larger company, solid knowledge of <strong>data structures</strong> (linked lists, graphs, arrays, trees, etc.) and <strong>algorithms</strong> (searching and sorting, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, runtime analysis, etc.) are a must-know! 
            To practice, <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/">LeetCode</a> has classic problems, and <i>Cracking the Coding Interview</i> is also a popular guide.
